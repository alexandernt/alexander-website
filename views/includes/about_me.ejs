    <h1 class="center-title">About Me</h1> 
    <p class="center-description">
        I’m deeply <a class="crossed__out--word ">passionate</a>  about the transformative power of data 
        in shaping business decisions. Data allows organizations to adapt, 
        grow, and innovate in ways they never imagined. Throughout my career, 
        I’ve focused on helping companies streamline their processes 
        and make smarter, data-driven decisions.
    </p>

    <p class="center-description">
        I believe every organization should leverage tools like process 
        automation to reduce errors, build insightful databases for 
        decision-making, and implement reports that highlight key 
        performance metrics. Even a small amount of well-organized 
        data can drive high-impact, strategic decisions.
    </p>

    <p class="center-description">
        I'm also passionate about crafting data 
        stories that not only inform but inspire action. 
        But beyond technical expertise, <a class="crossed__out--word ">soft skills are key</a>. 
        I thrive in collaborative environments and believe in building 
        strong relationships with stakeholders to foster trust and drive 
        efficiency.
